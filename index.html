										<p class="poem">My love, my Bianka, shining bright,<br>
                                            With hair as soft as summer night.<br>
                                            Your eyes, like embers, warm and true,<br>
                                            A guiding light, that shines anew.</p>
                                        <p class="poem">We first met in the town of Presov,<br>
                                           Where our hearts were filled with joy,<br>
                                           We laughed and talked, and fell in love,<br>
                                           And knew we'd never be alone.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="poem">Though distance keeps us far apart,<br>
                                            Our love will always have a start.<br>
                                            With every thought, my heart will sing,<br>
                                            For you, my love, my precious thing.</p>
                                        <p class="poem">So on this Valentine's Day, my dear,<br>
                                            I send you love, and nothing less.<br>
                                            A token of the love I hold,<br>
                                            For the one who makes my heart unfold.</p>
                                        <p class="poem">You are the kindest soul I know,<br>
                                             With a heart that's always aglow.<br>
                                              And every day, I'm grateful too,<br>
                                              To have a love, as bright as you.</p>
                                        <p class="poem">I'll be your rock, I'll be your guide,<br>
                                            Together, we'll take this world in stride.<br>
                                            With every step, our love will grow,<br>
                                            And all the world will surely know.</p>
                                        <p class="poem">I'll hold your hand and wipe away your tears,<br>
                                            And share with you all of life's delights.<br>
                                            Together, we'll conquer all our fears,<br>
                                            And create a future filled with light.</p>
                                        <p class="poem">So here's to you, my love, on this special day,<br>
                                            May happiness and joy come your way,<br>
                                            And when we are together, our love will be seen,<br>
                                            Forever and always, my beautiful Queen.</p>
                                        <p class="poem">Lukas</p>
